# Dastardlys Band Website

My project is designing a website for a local band called The Dastardlys.
The website will allow the band to showcase their music and allow users to view past performances, see the upcoming events schedule, and contact the band.
 
## UX
 
This website is for managers of live band venues, organisers of events and fans.

Managers of live band venues, organisers of events can use the website to source new acts, gauge the quality, professionalism and genre.

Fans cans use this website to find out if they enjoy the band, where and when the band will be playing

- As a pub owner I want to see if this band would be suitable for my pub by viewing videos in the gallery to see what music they play and how well they play.

- As an event host I want to hire the band so I will use the contact me page to get in touch.

- As a potential fan I want to watch videos to see if I would enjoy the music so I will view the gallery.

- As a fan of the band I want to find out where they are playing next so I will go to the events page.

## Technologies Used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to streamline styling and responsive design.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** because it is a requirement for Bootstrap.
- [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
    - The project uses **Favicon Generator** to generate favicons for multiple devices.

## Testing

Manual User Testing was conducted and found that scrolling didn't work on iframes and scrolling also didn't hide the dropdown.

- Iframe scrolling on gallery fixed in commit cc85bc99a5ab5b1c547c95bb0a6bb9d67c303d75.

- Scroll hiding navbar not completed as JavaScript is required.


Subscribe and contact forms will not submit without required boxes being filled and boxes requiring emails test for proper email format.

Navbar links tested on every page to confirm links lead to correct pages.
